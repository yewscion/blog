I want to obtain a PhD in Computer Science, and work in the research field in
some capacity (at least for a while). Getting there from here might be a long
road, but it is one I want to walk down. And recently, I've gotten some advice
that outlines a path I can take.")

remarkably few resources to begin work on it. In short, I didn't know what I
didn't know, and what I " (em "did") "know looked like an impassible
mountain. So, I decided it was time to start asking questions.")

Degree in Software Engineering. I'd also received an invite to a local "

people in the software field that I might be able to ask questions of. And
finally, just mentioning my goal to as many people as I can has worked for me"

aggregate, I received a few specific recommendations:")

Find out what You are actually interested in, as Computer Science has a lot of
subdisciplines.")

recommendation.  Don't lock Yourself down to a specific idea; try a lot of
different things to find out what really resonates with You before starting Your
graduate program.")

to get started. Reaching out to those local to me who are working (or have
worked) on something tangential to my interests, and asking to help them with
their work, is a great way to get involved."))
       (p "With this in mind, I'll start looking over the various subdisciplines
in Computer Science (expect a blog post on that as well), and move forward once
my survey of those is complete. Hopefully, I can (within the next year or so)
help someone out with some work they are currently doing, and start building up
the experience I'll need to get into this field.")

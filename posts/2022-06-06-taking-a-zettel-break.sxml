impulsive decision to set one up. It helped some things, for sure: I would not
have been able to complete my final speech on time in term 1 if I didn't have my
zettelkasten to rely on. However, I've recently discovered that maintaining a
zettelkasten might be antithetical to getting my BS in Computer Science. I hope
to explore why here.")

understanding and interpretation of the material You are interfacing with. It

be digesting a large amount of information and (hopefully) feeding it back into
a new paper that others might do the same to. For all intents and purposes, it
is a great system.")

away, I've found it much easier to keep up with the increasing
workload (sometimes I'll have to reference upwards of 8 new articles in a week!
Ingesting them into the zettelkasten would have taken me a full day by itself!)

straightforward."))))))
